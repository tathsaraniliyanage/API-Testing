The API lifecycle is the series of steps that teams must take in order to successfully design, develop, deploy, and consume APIs. Teams that follow a clearly defined API lifecycle are more productive and better equipped to deliver a high-quality API.

API lifecycle has 8 stages as follows :

   - define
   - design
   - develop
   - test
   - secure
   - deploy
   - observe
   - distribute

## Stage 1: Define

In the first stage of the API lifecycle, product managers and other stakeholders must define the operational, business, and security requirements for a single API or group of APIs. This requires them to agree on the API's intended use case—and identify the team members who will move it through each subsequent stage of the lifecycle. They should also create and configure a dedicated workspace where team members can collaborate, as well as a GitHub repository that is connected to a CI pipeline. These steps help stabilize the rest of the API lifecycle and establish locations and tooling for stage-specific work.


## Stage 2: Design

API design involves making intentional decisions about how an API will expose data to consumers. These decisions are then captured in an API definition, which is a human- and machine-readable representation of an API's intended functionality. API definitions adhere to API specifications, such as OpenAPI and AsyncAPI, which provide a standardized format and vocabulary for API definitions and lay the foundation for API contracts, documentation, mocks, and tests.


## Stage 3: Develop
After the API has been designed, developers are tasked with writing code that implements its intended functionality. Most development teams use Git for version control, which enables them to safely manage changes and revert to previous iterations if necessary. They also typically use GitHub or GitLab repositories to store their source code, keep track of code-related issues, and conduct code reviews. Development workflows vary widely, so it's important for leaders to clearly define these processes in order to standardize their team's approach.



## Stage 4: Test
API testing, which occurs during the “develop,” “secure,” and “deploy” stages of the API lifecycle, enables developers and QA teams to confirm that an API is working as expected. API tests can be executed manually, or they can be automatically run from multiple geographic regions or within CI/CD pipelines. Testing early and often helps teams surface and remediate issues before they become ingrained or reach production.


## Stage 5: Secure
The “secure” phase of the API lifecycle involves checking an API for common security vulnerabilities that can compromise an application's overall security posture. For instance, it's important to confirm that an API's authentication logic only allows legitimate users to interact with the API and access its data. These API security checks can be run manually or automatically within CI/CD pipelines, and they help ensure that every API within an organization's portfolio follows the same security standards.

## Stage 6: Deploy
The “deploy” stage of the API lifecycle refers to the process of publishing APIs to development, staging, and production environments. Many teams leverage CI/CD pipelines and API gateways to standardize the deployment process and ensure that every batch of changes is properly tested and secured before it reaches consumers. Consistent processes make deployments more predictable, which is particularly important for agile teams that ship new code several times a week.


## Stage 7: Observe
The “observe” stage of the API lifecycle involves collecting, visualizing, and alerting on API telemetry data in production. During this stage, SREs and DevOps engineers will configure monitors to automatically notify them of API performance and security issues—and leverage APM tools that place API performance data in context. API observability plays a crucial role in surfacing errors, latency, and security vulnerabilities before they negatively impact dependent services, partners, and customers.

## Stage 8: Distribute
During the “distribute” stage, teams will focus on improving their API's discoverability. API catalogs play a crucial role in this stage. Public API catalogs help API producers reach and support third-party consumers, while private API catalogs make it easier for internal teams to collaborate and consume one another's APIs. Every API should also include a detailed description and relevant tags, which will help ensure it can be surfaced by the catalog's search engine.
