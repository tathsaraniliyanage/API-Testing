## API Introduction & Types

An API, which stands for application programming interface, is a set of protocols that enable different software components to communicate and transfer data. Developers use APIs to bridge the gaps between small, discrete chunks of code in order to create applications that are powerful, resilient, secure, and able to meet user needs.


## API Testing

API testing is a process that confirms an API is working as expected. There are several types of API tests, and each one plays a distinct role in ensuring that the API's functionality, security, and performance remain reliable. Developers can run API tests manually, or they can automate them with an API testing tool.


## API Lifecycle

The API lifecycle is the series of steps that teams must take in order to successfully design, develop, deploy, and consume APIs. Teams that follow a clearly defined API lifecycle are more productive and better equipped to deliver a high-quality API.


## API Client

An API client is a development tool that makes it easier for producers and consumers to explore, test, and debug APIs. Traditional approaches to calling an API require a significant amount of specialized knowledge; for instance, the API user must know a programming language, understand the API's framework and protocol, and be able to interpret the response.


## API Design

API design is the process of making intentional decisions about how an API will expose data and functionality to its consumers. A successful API design describes the API's endpoints, methods, and resources in a standardized specification format.


## API Test automation

API test automation is the process of using a testing tool to programmatically execute API tests at certain times or frequencies, or in CI/CD pipelines. It is particularly important for agile development teams, as it enables them to maintain fast-paced development cycles while continuously and systematically verifying that their API is working as expected. 

## API Monitoring

API monitoring is the process of gathering, visualizing, and alerting on API telemetry data to ensure that API requests are handled as expected.
