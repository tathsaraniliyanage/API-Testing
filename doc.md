# API -testing
API testing can help teams confirm that their API's endpoints, methods, and integrations are functioning as expected.

API (Application Programming Interface) testing is a type of software testing that involves testing APIs directly and as part of integration testing to determine whether they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security. Unlike UI testing, API testing focuses on the business logic layer of the software architecture.

## Key Aspects of API Testing:
Functionality: Ensuring the API works as expected.

Reliability: Ensuring the API can be consistently connected to and deliver consistent results.

Performance: Ensuring the API performs well under load.

Security: Ensuring the API is secure from external threats.
